I had the opportunity to go to the one in malibu where its right next to the beach. Defineatlye recommend but only for special occasions unless your rich enough to spend $200 on a dinner every weekend </p>

			<p>Saw some amazing fire works at the park today! Had to wait for over an hour because there was a delay. Lasted about 30 mins and was a kinda weak at first. Then the last 5 mins, big huge ones were filling the sky. Saved the best for last.</p>
