		<p align="center"> I am a senior at CSUN pursing a Computer Science Degree. Pursing this degree will help me get one step closer in landing a secure job in city government. I currently am a project assistant in the Burea of Sanitation for the LA City Gov and have been working there for the past 3 years. Although landing this job is a goal, my ulitmate goal is to use the money I make to travel. I want to travel all of Asia (I have been to Philippines/Singapore/Taiwan) and then visit all of Europe. On top of that, I am also a huge Laker fan and have been since I was a little kid. If I'm not broke from traveling, being a Lakers season ticket holder is also a dream of mine</p>
